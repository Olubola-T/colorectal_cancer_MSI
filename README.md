# Detection of Microsatellite Instability in Colorectal Cancer Using Deep Learning-Based Histology Image Classification

These are some of the code notebooks for my dissertation study.

Colorectal cancer is a disease of global health importance as it is the third-commonest cancer and second-commonest cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Its management constitutes a huge economic and social burden to individuals and governments. Genetic studies constitute an important part of colorectal cancer management, and one of them is detection of microsatellite stability status, which is useful for prognostication and therapeutic decision making. The conventional methods for conducting this study are expensive, time-consuming, and not available in many underdeveloped and developing countries. This translates to challenges in patient management. Leveraging on previous works that have applied deep learning to proffer solutions to challenges in healthcare delivery, this study explores the detection of microsatellite instability using deep learning-based classification of colorectal cancer histology images. Models built from scratch as well as pretrained models were deployed for the task and compared for efficiency, using metrics such as accuracy, positive predictive value, training time, and floating operation points. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping was used to visualize the decision making of the models.
